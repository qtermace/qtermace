<!-- // Facts // -->
<div class="facts">

	<p>I'm 20 yo and I was born in <span class="highlight">Pskov, Russia</span>. It's a small town not far away from Saint-Petersburg.
	When I was 17, my mom moved to Saint-Petersburg and I started going there often to visit her.
	From time to time, I also lived in <span class="highlight">Riga, Latvia</span>, as my father is from there.
	And now I live in <span class="highlight">Oxford, England</span>.
	I can't really say which one of these three towns (or countries) I consider to be my home now. I love each one of them. However, a place where I live in Riga has a special place in my heart. My house is in the forest in 15 minutes away from the sea.
  I go there often with my friends when I'm there. I love the sea. My background picture, by the way, is the photo from one of my favourite spots that I've taken myself! The sunset that day was particularly beautiful.</p>

	<!-- Cope and paste your favourite emoji from here: https://textfancy.com/emoji/ -->
	<p>My favourite emoji is &#128036;.
	Baby chicks are so cute. &#129402;</p>

	<p>When I was a kid, I really loved reading. Then I got into writing too. That is why I've chosen <span class="highlight">Media, Journalism and Publishing</span> as my degree. Being a student quite often means that you don't really
		have the time to read for fun (or I'm just bad at time-management), but I still try to read when I have the chance. Now I'm
		reading <a class="fact_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Times_(novel)" target="blank">Hard Times</a> by Charles Dickens.</p>

	<p> I also really love watching movies. I've watched so many of them. However, it's hard for me to really <i>like</i> something. So I don't have many favourite movies.
		But one of them is definitely <a class="fact_link" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276919/" target="blank">Dogville</a>.

	<p> Another thing that I just can't live without is animals. I mean, <i>what</i> can be better than petting a little furry adorable creature? I have a cat back
		home. She is gorgeous. Her name is Alice. I haven't seen her in almost a year because the borders to Russia are still closed due to Coronavirus. I miss her.
		Here is <span class="highlight">a picture of her:</span>

		<img class="fact_image" src="img/alice.jpg">
	</a>
	You'll see something funny if you click on her picture ;)
	</p>

	<p>Not long ago I also made friends with some cows. <span class="highlight">Have a look:</span>
     <img class="fact_image" src="img/cows.jpg">
		 I've stopped eating meat when I was 15 yo, but I still eat fish and sometimes consume milk products. One day I'll hopefully go vegan!

	</p>

	<!-- News -->
	<p>We live in a strange time when a lot of things are going on. It's important than ever to be updated. Here are some news websites I go to every day to keep myself up to date:</p>

	<ul class="news">

		<li><a class="fact_link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk" target="blank">TheGuardian</a></li>

		<li><a class="fact_link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/" target="blank">BBC News</a></li>

		<li><a class="fact_link" href="https://news.sky.com/watch-live" target="blank">Sky News</a></li>

		<li><a class="fact_link" href="https://www.vice.com/en" target="blank">Vice</a></li>

	</ul>

	<p class="fact">I also really love music. And bubble tea. My favourite is <span class="highlight">Brown Sugar Milk Boba</span>. If you've never tried it - you <b> must </b> do it! You won't regret. Promise :) </p>

	<p class="fact">Every day I try to remind myself about how lucky I am and how grateful I am for everything that I have in my life like
		amazing friends and family that loves me. I am happy now. And my dream is just <span class="highlight">to keep being happy, travelling the world and becoming a better version of myself</span>.</p>
